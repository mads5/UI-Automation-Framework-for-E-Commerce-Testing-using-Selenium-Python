#Project Title: UI Automation Framework for E-Commerce Testing (using Selenium Python)

#Description

This project provides a Python automation framework for testing various functionalities of an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver. It demonstrates the following capabilities:

User Registration and Login: Automate account creation and login processes.
Product Management: Add and remove products from the shopping cart.
Address Management: Create, edit, and verify saved addresses within user profiles.

#Prerequisites

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Selenium (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
WebDriver (https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
ChromeDriver: Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) for your browser and place it in your system's PATH or in the same directory as this script.

#Installation

Install required dependencies:

Bash
pip install selenium
Use code with caution.
Download and configure ChromeDriver as mentioned in the Prerequisites section.

#Usage

Clone this repository or download the code files.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run the script:

Bash
python test_script.py
Use code with caution.

#Note:

This script is designed to work with the provided sample e-commerce website (https://practice.automationtesting.in/). It may require adjustments for other websites due to potential variations in HTML structure and element identification methods.

#Additional Considerations

Consider using a configuration file to store website URLs, credentials, and other environment-specific details for improved flexibility and maintainability.
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios during test execution.
Explore page object model (POM) design for better code organization and reusability.
If integrating with a real e-commerce website, ensure you have the necessary permissions and adhere to their terms of use for automation testing.
